Much has been said about the authenticity of the video Sarah Huckabee Sander's 
posted on her twitter account. Most recently Kellyanne Conway claimed the video
was only sped up. Collecting the Motion History of each image  and diffing the 
motion frame by frame I noticed a few frames where there is no motion in the 
Info Wars video. Seems like there is strong evidence that Kellyanne Conway 
maybe mistaken here. The Info Wars video is edited beyond speed changes.
